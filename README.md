My name is Megan and I recently received a master's degree from Carnegie Mellon University in public policy and data analytics. My interest in the intersection of public policy and data began during my undergraduate research in social psychology. I found that academia often missed the broader meaning beyond the lab and data results. I was inspired to bridge the profound gap between research and policy, and became an AmeriCorps VISTA immediately following my college graduation.

I worked at [WomenVenture](https://www.womenventure.org/about/), as the Research and Technology Specialist. I helped women of all backgrounds become economically self-sufficient by empowering them to start small businesses, with a focus on low-income and racially diverse women. One of my biggest responsibilities was helping the leadership team understand the impact our services were having in the community. I redesigned and implemented WomenVenture's annual client survey and synthesized survey data to recommend program improvements to leadership. I quickly learned that the challenge in collecting field data through qualitative research was the lack of trust the community members had in me, a temporary consultant figure for the organization. I realized the importance of sustainable relationships in the delivery of services. When I suggested a senior team member assist me in collecting responses in the field, we greatly improved our response rate. I was ultimately able to build relationships with the clients the more I made an effort to show my face in person and be present in the room ‚Äì something I feel is often missing in community-based, mission-driven projects.

Following my graduation from CMU, I'm pursuing opportunities where I can use my research and data skills for social good. I have experience utilizing research and data science tools to inform and shape impactful public policy decisions. I most recently worked as a data science consultant building a computer vision model to help aid law enforcement agencies in the U.K locate victims of human trafficking.

Below are some highlights of research and data science projects I have worked: 
- Helping design original [social psychology research](https://wp.stolaf.edu/news/researchers-examine-the-benefits-of-discussing-discrimination) in undergrad that explored the underlying effects of emotional disclosure on meaning-making and coping following an experience of discrimination. 
- Increasing digital equity in Detroit, Michigan with Connect313. Connect313 is a citywide, mulitstakeholder initiative to help bridge the digital divide in Detroit and have all residents have access to a device, IT support, and broadband by 2024. Below is a screenshot of the internal dashboard I spent the summer updating:

- Investigating the correlation between [urban heat and impoverished neighborhoods](https://arcg.is/1fCW1K0) in Allegheny County.
- Mapping [New York City shootings](https://mehussey.shinyapps.io/FinalProject/) from 2019-2021 on R Shiny.
- Modeling the correlation between [poor bridge conditions and income level/racial demographics in Pittsburgh city](https://github.com/megan0422/DABPFinalProject) and then optimizing government funding to areas with the poorest bridge conditions. This project was inspired by the [Fern Hollow Bridge collapse](https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/pittsburgh-bridge-collapse-fern-hollow-one-year-later-infrastructure-bridges-president-biden/) in 2022.
