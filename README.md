### ‚ú®Thanks for visiting my page!‚ú®

My name is Megan and I recently received a master's degree from Carnegie Mellon University in public policy and data analytics. I'm passionate about using data for social good in the U.S., and have experience utilizing research and data science tools to inform and shape impactful public policy decisions. I recently worked as a data science consultant building a computer vision model to help aid law enforcement agencies in the U.K locate victims of human trafficking.

Some other highlights of research and data science projects I have worked on include: 
- Increasing digital equity in Detroit, Michigan with Connect313. Connect313 is a citywide, mulitstakeholder initiative to help bridge the digital divide in Detroit and have all residents have access to a device, IT support, and broadband by 2024. 
- Helping design original [social psychology research](https://wp.stolaf.edu/news/researchers-examine-the-benefits-of-discussing-discrimination) in undergrad that explored the underlying effects of emotional disclosure on meaning-making and coping following an experience of discrimination. 
- Investigating the correlation between [urban heat and impoverished neighborhoods](https://arcg.is/1fCW1K0) in Allegheny County.
- Mapping [New York City shootings](https://mehussey.shinyapps.io/FinalProject/) from 2019-2021 on R Shiny.
- Modeling the correlation between [poor bridge conditions and income level/racial demographics in Pittsburgh city](https://github.com/megan0422/DABPFinalProject) and then optimizing government funding to areas with the poorest bridge conditions. This project was inspired by the [Fern Hollow Bridge collapse](https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/pittsburgh-bridge-collapse-fern-hollow-one-year-later-infrastructure-bridges-president-biden/) in 2022.
