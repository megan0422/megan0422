### ✨Thanks for visiting my github!✨

My name is Megan and recently received a master's degree from Carnegie Mellon University in public policy and data analytics. I'm passionate about using data for social good in the U.S., and have experience working on projects related to access to technology and digital equity, infrastructure funding, and healthcare. I recently completed my master's capstone project, building a computer vision model to help aid law enforcement agencies in the U.K locate victims of human trafficking.

In my free time, you can find me:
- In a cycling class🚴‍♂️
- Cooking with my roommates🍴
- Checking out local breweries🍻
