### ‚ú®Thanks for visiting my page!‚ú®

My name is Megan and I recently received a master's degree from Carnegie Mellon University in public policy and data analytics. I'm passionate about using data for social good in the U.S., and have experience working on projects related to access to technology and digital equity, infrastructure funding, and healthcare. I recently worked as a data science consultant building a computer vision model to help aid law enforcement agencies in the U.K locate victims of human trafficking.

Some other highlights of research/data science projects I have worked on include: 
- Increasing digital equity in Detroit, Michigan with Connect313. Connect313 is a citywide, mulitstakeholder initiative to help bridge the digital divide in Detroit and have all residents have access to a device, IT support, and broadband by 2024.

- Helping design original [social psychology research](https://wp.stolaf.edu/news/researchers-examine-the-benefits-of-discussing-discrimination) in undergrad that explores the underlying effects of emotional disclosure on meaning-making and coping following an experience of discrimination. 
- Investigating the correlation between [urban heat and impoverished neighborhoods](https://arcg.is/1fCW1K0) in Allegheny County.
