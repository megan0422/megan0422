### ✨Thanks for visiting my page!✨

My name is Megan and I hold a master's degree from Carnegie Mellon University in public policy and data analytics. I'm pursuing opportunities where I can use my research and data skills for social good and dive into the world of civic technology. I have experience utilizing research and data science tools to inform and shape impactful public policy decisions. One of my favorite data projects included working as a data science consultant building a computer vision model to help aid law enforcement agencies in the U.K locate victims of human trafficking. I am currently in a local government data analyst role at the City of Charlotte.

In my free time, you can find me:
- In a cycling class🚴‍♂️
- Trying out NYT Cooking recipes🍴
- Checking out local breweries🍻
- Embracing the harsh winter in my hometown of Minneapolis, MN❄️
